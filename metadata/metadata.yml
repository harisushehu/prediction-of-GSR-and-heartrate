name: Prediction of moment-by-moment heart rate and skin conductance changes in the
  context of varying emotional arousal
description: "This repository contains the source code for our paper: Prediction of
  moment-by-moment heart rate and skin conductance changes in the context of varying
  emotional arousal Psychophysiology Journal, 2023 Shehu, H. A., Oxner, M., Browne,
  W., & Eisenbarth, H. \n\nThe code is for the research on investigating the moment-by-moment
  brain activity to predict emotional arousal-related autonomic nervous systems (i.e.
  heart rate and skin conductance) responses of participants as they watched emotion-provoking
  videos. The study investigates the physiological delay of the data by performing
  an analysis using temporal shifts and then performing a data selection approach
  analysis to examine the effect of individual differences on the autonomic nervous
  systems responses. Lastly, the study performed feature selection to determine the
  minimum number of features, as well as investigated the brain patterns that play
  a role in predicting these measures.\n\nThe codes for predicting heart rate, skin
  conductance response, extracting features from EEG signals and selecting the minimum
  number of features that contribute to predicting heart rate and skin conductance
  responses are all included in the capsule."
